FAQ [​](#faq)

Common questions about reuse, storage, and compatibility. For a specific build problem, start with [Troubleshooting](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/troubleshooting).

## Is deleting the cache safe? [​](#is-deleting-the-cache-safe)

The shared compiler outputs can be rebuilt. Prefer `mbx gc --dry-run` and `mbx gc` to reclaim space under the configured policy. Deleting the whole cache root also removes managed targets and private incremental state; stop running builds first. See [stability](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/stability#the-store-is-disposable).

## Why wasn't my first build faster? [​](#why-wasn-t-my-first-build-faster)

A cold store has no results to restore. The first compilation records inputs and outputs for later reuse. A second command in the same target may simply be fresh according to Cargo; use [fresh targets](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/cache-results#measure-cache-reuse) to measure the shared cache. See [cache results](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/cache-results#troubleshooting-a-low-hit-rate), and the [warm scenario](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/benchmarks#warm-build) for what that second build gets.

## Why does a fully warm build still take time? [​](#why-does-a-fully-warm-build-still-take-time)

Cargo still plans the build, mbx validates inputs and materializes outputs, and any unsupported actions run normally. Eligible host binaries and tests can be restored on Linux, macOS, and Windows; links with unmodeled inputs still run. See the [limits](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/limits#native-linking-is-cached-only-where-the-linker-can-be-described).

## The cache stopped hitting after a Rust update. Is it broken? [​](#the-cache-stopped-hitting-after-a-rust-update-is-it-broken)

No. The compiler is part of every key, so a toolchain roll invalidates every rustc action at once, and the build says so: `a manifest predicting N compilations was loaded, but none matched this build`. Actions that do not depend on rustc, such as a build script's C objects, survive.

## Can I use mbx together with sccache? [​](#can-i-use-mbx-together-with-sccache)

No. Both wrap rustc through `RUSTC_WRAPPER`, so they cannot be combined for the same build; with `RUSTC_WRAPPER` already set, mbx defers to it and does not cache. See [migrate from rust-cache or sccache](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/cookbook/migrate).

## Are restored artifacts byte-identical to what a compile would produce? [​](#are-restored-artifacts-byte-identical-to-what-a-compile-would-produce)

Equivalent, not always identical: rustc and C compilers record absolute source paths in metadata and debug information, so artifacts from two checkouts can differ without behaving differently. [`MBX_VERIFY=1`](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/configuration#verify-mode) compares bytes and names what differed. See [limits](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/limits#restored-artifacts-are-equivalent-not-always-identical).

## Where does everything live? [​](#where-does-everything-live)

`mbx cache dir` prints the store's location. Managed target directories live under that root by default; [`target.root`](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/managed-targets#change-target-placement) can place them elsewhere. Configuration comes from the paths listed in [Configuration](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/configuration).

## How do I turn one feature off? [​](#how-do-i-turn-one-feature-off)

Every feature has its own switch:

| Switch | Turns off |
| --- | --- |
| `MBX_SCHEDULER=0` | [machine-wide compile scheduling](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/scheduling#machine-wide-compile-scheduling) |
| `MBX_CC=0` | [build-script and `mbx exec` C and C++ caching](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/configuration#build-script-c-and-c) |
| `MBX_TARGET_VIEWS=0` | [managed target directories](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/managed-targets#disable-managed-targets) |
| `MBX_CACHE_LINKS=0` | [native link caching](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/limits#native-linking-is-cached-only-where-the-linker-can-be-described) |
| `MBX_LEARNED_INCREMENTAL=0` | [learned incremental reuse](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/incremental#learned-incremental-reuse) |
| `MBX_EVENTS=0` | [per-compilation event streams](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/tui#recording) |
| `MBX_SAVINGS=off` | [the savings line](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/configuration#the-savings-line) |

## Something looks wrong. What should a report include? [​](#something-looks-wrong-what-should-a-report-include)

`mbx doctor --json`, a run with `MBX_LOG=debug`, and `MBX_BYPASS_LOG`. See [reporting a problem](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/troubleshooting#reporting-a-problem).

## Why is it called Mr. Boxington? [​](#why-is-it-called-mr-boxington)

The project is named after this cardboard box, christened “Mr. Boxington” by jdx's daughter while he was working on mbx. The name stuck.

For non-English speakers

The joke is in “Boxington”: it combines *box* with *-ington*, an ending familiar from English place names and surnames. The result makes an ordinary cardboard box sound like a distinguished gentleman.
