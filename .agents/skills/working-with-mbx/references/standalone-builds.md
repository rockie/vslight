Cache C and C++ builds outside Cargo

Cache C and C++ builds outside Cargo [​](#cache-c-and-c-builds-outside-cargo)

Use `mbx exec` to cache compiler calls made by make, CMake, and other build tools:

sh

```
mbx exec make -j8
```

For CMake, run the configure step through `mbx exec` too. CMake chooses a compiler while configuring and reuses that choice when it builds.

sh

```
mbx exec cmake -S . -B build
mbx exec cmake --build build
```

Only the command after `mbx exec` uses these compiler wrappers. There is no daemon or global compiler setup. For C and C++ compiled by Cargo build scripts, use `mbx build`; that integration is [enabled by default](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/configuration#build-script-c-and-c).

## What `mbx exec` does [​](#what-mbx-exec-does)

While the command runs, mbx puts wrappers for the common compiler names at the front of `PATH`:

text

```
cc  c++  gcc  g++  clang  clang++
```

On Windows it wraps `cl.exe` instead.

When the build tool calls one of those names, mbx checks the cache first. On a hit, it restores the object file. On a miss, it runs the compiler that would normally have been found on `PATH` and saves the result.

The wrappers use the same local and remote cache as Cargo builds. The command's exit status and compiler output are passed through unchanged, and the wrappers go away from `PATH` when the command finishes.

## CMake and other configured builds [​](#cmake-and-other-configured-builds)

Some build systems save the compiler's absolute path during configuration. CMake writes it to `CMakeCache.txt`; autoconf may write it into generated makefiles. If configuration happens outside `mbx exec`, the saved path points straight to the compiler and later `mbx exec` builds cannot intercept it.

For an existing CMake build configured with a direct compiler path, configure a fresh build directory through `mbx exec`. Changing `PATH` during a later build does not replace the compiler saved in `CMakeCache.txt`.

Configure through `mbx exec` so the build system records mbx's wrapper. That path remains valid across later commands. You should still use `mbx exec` for each build you want cached:

sh

```
# Configure once.
mbx exec cmake -S . -B build

# Build as often as needed.
mbx exec cmake --build build
```

Running `cmake --build build` without `mbx exec` still works, but it calls the real compiler without using the cache.

## What gets cached [​](#what-gets-cached)

mbx caches ordinary gcc-, clang-, and MSVC-style compile commands that compile one C or C++ source file into an object. It also caches GCC/Clang preprocessing to a file (`-E ... -o file`), using checkout-specific keys to preserve literal paths in the output. It does not cache links, multi-source compiler calls, or commands whose behavior it cannot model safely. Those commands still run normally; the session summary counts their bypasses, and `MBX_SUMMARY=full` reports the grouped reasons.

`mbx exec` only intercepts the unversioned compiler names listed above. It leaves commands such as `gcc-13`, absolute compiler paths, and explicitly selected cross-compilers alone.

See [limits](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/limits#c-and-c-caching-covers-the-host-compiles-mbx-drives) for the complete list of supported and bypassed invocations.

## Sharing results across checkouts [​](#sharing-results-across-checkouts)

mbx removes the checkout's absolute path from compilation keys, so equivalent checkouts can share cached objects. It normally treats the enclosing Git or Jujutsu checkout as the project root. Outside a checkout, it uses the working directory. Override that choice with `--project-root`:

sh

```
mbx exec --project-root /path/to/project make -j8
```

To find the same project in another checkout, mbx uses the `Cargo.lock` digest when one exists, then the Git or Jujutsu `origin` URL, and finally the directory name. If only the directory name is available, matching directory names are required for cross-checkout hits.

## Disabling the cache [​](#disabling-the-cache)

Set `MBX_CC=0` to run the command without C or C++ caching:

sh

```
MBX_CC=0 mbx exec make
```

C and C++ compilation is the only work `mbx exec` caches, so this runs the command without compiler caching. For published artifacts, follow the [production release policy](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/github-action#production-releases).
