Parallel builds

Parallel builds [​](#parallel-builds)

Give independent Cargo commands their own target directories. mbx coordinates their real compiler processes through a shared CPU and memory budget; Cargo continues to plan dependencies within each build.

## Run independent tasks [​](#run-independent-tasks)

Any task runner can start multiple mbx commands at the same time. For example, mise runs these two lint configurations together:

toml

```
# mise.toml
[tasks."lint:default"]
run = "mbx clippy --workspace -- -D warnings"
env.CARGO_TARGET_DIR = "target/clippy-default"

[tasks."lint:all"]
run = "mbx clippy --workspace --all-features --all-targets -- -D warnings"
env.CARGO_TARGET_DIR = "target/clippy-all"
```

sh

```
mise run lint:default ::: lint:all
```

Separate target directories keep Cargo's directory lock from serializing the commands. mbx shares one machine-wide compiler pool and deduplicates identical work in flight without further configuration. See [how it works](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/how-it-works#machine-wide-scheduling) for the mechanism and the same shape [inside GitHub Actions](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/github-action#parallel-cargo-steps).

## Machine-wide compile scheduling [​](#machine-wide-compile-scheduling)

Each Cargo process sets its own concurrency. Without coordination, several builds can collectively start more compiler processes than the machine can comfortably run. mbx coordinates them through a shared pool under the cache directory. Scheduling is on by default; `MBX_SCHEDULER=0` disables it.

A permit represents a share of the pool's CPU and memory budget. The pool has `scheduler.cpus` permits (default: logical CPUs), minus `scheduler.reserve_cpus` (default: 0), with at least one permit remaining. `scheduler.memory` defaults to 85% of physical memory. In a Linux container, the cgroup's memory limit constrains that budget.

Compiler processes take permits according to their estimated memory use. Unmeasured compilations start at one permit; native links start at two and can use estimates from earlier links. Measurements refine later admissions. Set `scheduler.memory = "none"` to use CPU permits without memory weighting.

Cache hits do not need compiler permits. If a process dies, the kernel releases its permits. For the weighting and recovery details, see [how it works](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/how-it-works#machine-wide-scheduling).

Use `scheduler.priority = "low"` (`MBX_SCHEDULER_PRIORITY=low`) for an editor's background check or CI on a shared machine. While normal-priority work is waiting, low-priority builds leave a quarter of the pool available for it.

## Choose the scope of a limit [​](#choose-the-scope-of-a-limit)

| Limit | Affects |
| --- | --- |
| `scheduler.cpus`, `scheduler.memory` | The shared compiler pool |
| `scheduler.reserve_cpus` | Capacity left outside that pool |
| Cargo `-j` or `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS` | How much of the pool one build may hold |
| `scheduler.priority = "low"` | Whether a build yields to waiting normal-priority work |

A memory budget schedules work using measurements; it is not an operating-system memory limit. A compiler process can still exceed its estimate. For laptop settings, see [Keep a laptop responsive](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/cookbook/local-development#keep-a-laptop-responsive).
