Watching builds

Watching builds [​](#watching-builds)

`mbx tui` shows live and recent builds using the same local cache. Open it in a second terminal while a build runs:

sh

```
mbx tui
```

*Live, with example build data. Open any screenshot at full size to read the details.*

`mbx tui` shows one row per compilation, with its crate name and cache outcome. For the end-of-build summary, see [Cache results](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/cache-results).

The TUI reads local session files; it does not need a daemon or cache server. Each build appends its decisions to a stream under the cache, and the dashboard reads those streams. It shows builds in other terminals, builds that started before you opened it, and any number of builds at once.

## Screens [​](#screens)

**Live** lists recorded builds and, for the selected one, the compilations as they are decided. Outcomes are colored: green for a hit, red for a miss, grey when no lookup was possible, yellow for a bypass, cyan for a successful verification, and magenta for a verification mismatch.

The selected build stays visible as you move through the list. The activity panel follows the newest compilations by default. Use `Page Up` and `Page Down` to read older activity, and `End` to return to the latest. New events keep arriving while you read history, without shifting the rows you are inspecting. Narrow terminals show fewer build columns; the selected build's counts also appear above its activity.

On wider terminals, Live adds a sidebar with lookup traffic, the selected build's cache-hit gauge, and its biggest compilation savings. The hit and miss graphs share a scale and cover the last five minutes observed by the TUI; idle intervals stay empty. The header groups compiler time saved, store capacity, and evictions into separate metric panels.

The hit rate shown is over *attempted lookups*, the same as the summary's. A cold build that looked nothing up shows `-`, not `0%`, because those are different facts.

**Sessions** lists finished builds with the totals each one ended with, the same numbers `MBX_STATS_REPORT` would have written.

**Store** shows what the store holds and what mbx has saved on this machine since it started counting, with a date and human-readable compiler time. It also shows pruning totals, reflinked bytes, and estimated workspace sharing; [`mbx stats`](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/stats) explains the figures and prints them without opening the TUI. Use `↑`/`↓` or `Page Up`/`Page Down` to scroll the Store screen. On larger terminals, inventory, lifetime savings, and workspace sharing each get a panel. Reports that need more room use the scrollable layout.

*Store, with example build data. Sharing and compiler savings are estimates.*

**Insights** explains the build selected in Live. It shows:

- An outcome chart over all recorded actions, alongside the lookup-only hit rate. Bypassed and unconsulted work are visible without lowering that rate.
- A strip of recent outcomes, ordered oldest to newest. Each letter represents one action, not a fixed interval of time. On wider terminals a duration graph below the strip shows which of those actions took the longest.
- Bypass reasons ranked by frequency, with each reason's share of bypasses.
- The slowest recorded actions, with their outcomes. A hit's duration measures restoring outputs; other durations measure compiler work.
- The biggest cache wins, ranked by estimated compiler time avoided, plus total estimated compiler time saved and bytes restored for the build.

*Insights, with example build data. Action durations measure recorded work, not elapsed build time.*

Use `j`/`k` or `↑`/`↓` to inspect another build without leaving Insights, and `Page Up`/`Page Down` to scroll. Rankings cover the most recent 2,000 retained actions. Charts count recorded actions even after they leave that window; if the stream hits its recording cap, Insights marks its data as incomplete. Compiler time saved is cumulative work avoided, not elapsed wall-clock time: compilations can run in parallel.

With enough room, Insights arranges its charts and rankings in a dashboard. `Page Down` opens the full detail view; `Page Up` returns to the dashboard.

A build's state is one of:

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `live` | a build is running and still appending |
| `finished` | the build ended and recorded its totals |
| `abandoned` | the build died before it could record them |

`abandoned` is not an error mbx reports; it is what a stream looks like when the process writing it is gone. A build killed mid-compile shows up this way instead of appearing to run forever.

## Store pressure [​](#store-pressure)

The header shows store bytes against the configured `gc.max_size` budget with an inline usage bar. It turns yellow at 90% and red at or above 100%; a store can temporarily exceed its budget between sweeps. This is the action-store budget, not free disk space. A configured combined target/store/incremental budget can reduce the actual allowance further. Automatic collection being off is shown explicitly.

Evicted bytes are shown for the last five minutes of observation and for the lifetime of the savings ledger. These count cache-store collection, including explicit `mbx gc`, and exclude target-directory cleanup. The recent counter starts when the TUI opens; it does not treat old ledger totals as new evictions. Resuming after a pause starts a new observation period.

A **POSSIBLE CACHE THRASHING** banner appears on every screen when all of these hold within the last five minutes:

- The eviction counter increased in at least three separate observations.
- Evicted bytes total at least 25% of the configured store budget.
- At least 20 new lookups were observed, with a miss rate of 50% or more.

The banner alternates red and yellow once per second while keeping its text visible. The Store screen gives the evidence and suggests inspecting misses and the cache budget. This is a warning heuristic, not proof that specific misses were caused by eviction. A single cleanup, a cold build without repeated eviction, and a reset ledger do not trigger it. It clears as the observations leave the five-minute window. Counter observations are not an exact count of GC runs; several runs may fall between reads.

## Keys [​](#keys)

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `q`, `Esc`, `Ctrl-C` | quit |
| `Tab`, `→` | next screen |
| `Shift-Tab`, `←` | previous screen |
| `1`, `2`, `3`, `4` | jump to Live, Sessions, Store, Insights |
| `j`, `k`, `↓`, `↑` | select a build in Live or Insights; scroll Sessions or Store |
| `Page Up`, `Page Down` | browse activity history in Live; scroll Insights or Store |
| `End` | follow the latest activity in Live |
| `p` | pause and resume reading |

Click a tab to switch screens. Click a build in Live to select it, or a row in Sessions to open that build in Live. The mouse wheel selects builds over the Live build list, browses history over Activity, and scrolls the Sessions, Store, and Insights reports. Scrolling up in Activity shows older events; scrolling down returns toward the latest events.

## Without a terminal [​](#without-a-terminal)

`mbx tui --once` prints one plain-text snapshot and exits, for a pipe, a CI log, or a quick look that does not take over the terminal.

sh

```
mbx tui --once
```

text

```
store: /home/you/.cache/mbx/actions
objects: 44 (8.6 MiB); action results: 7 (2.5 KiB)

command                             state         hit   miss  unconsulted  bypass
mbx check --workspace               live            0      0            4       3
mbx build                           finished        3      0            0       3
mbx build                           finished        0      0            3       3
```

## Recording [​](#recording)

Recording is on by default. A build appends one short line per compilation directly to its stream, with no buffering, so the dashboard is live. The cost is one small append against a compilation measured in milliseconds. Turn it off with `events = false` or `MBX_EVENTS=0` to disable session event recording. Cache entries and other build state are still stored.

Streams live beside the rest of the store's bookkeeping:

text

```
<store>/sessions/v1/<session>.jsonl   one line per decision
<store>/sessions/v1/<session>.lock    held for as long as the build runs
```

The lock is how a stream says it is still being written. Whoever can take it is looking at a build that has ended, however it ended, because the operating system releases the lock with the process either way.

Collection bounds them without any configuration: a stream is dropped once it is a week old or once it is not among the newest 256, and a single build stops adding rows after 16 MiB by default, though its totals are still recorded. Change that cap with [`events_max_size`](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/configuration#events-max-size). A stream a build is still writing is never collected. `mbx gc --dry-run` reports what it would drop alongside everything else.

Session history does not affect cache keys or count against the action-store size budget. Deleting finished session files removes their rows from the TUI and the history available to `mbx explain --last`, without removing compiled artifacts.

Not a stable format

The event files are an implementation detail of `mbx tui` and may change in any release. Scripts should read `MBX_STATS_REPORT`, which is [versioned](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/stability#json-output-is-versioned).

## Wrapper phase traces [​](#wrapper-phase-traces)

Rustc and C/C++ cache attempts also record startup, key construction, cache lookup, blob transfer, restore, store, prediction recording, compiler execution, and scheduler waits. `MBX_STATS_REPORT` includes these as `wrapper_phases_ns`. The durations are cumulative across wrappers and exclusive: nested work is subtracted from its parent phase. They do not add up to build wall time because compilers run in parallel. Work without a phase is reported as `unattributed`.

To inspect a saved build in Perfetto, export its session file:

sh

```
mbx cache trace "$(mbx cache dir)/sessions/v1/<session>.jsonl" > trace.json
```

Open `trace.json` in [Perfetto](https://ui.perfetto.dev). Each wrapper process has its own lane, with nested phases under the invocation. Trace spans are bounded to 512 per wrapper; totals continue accumulating after that limit. Telemetry delivery itself is excluded. A declined cache attempt ends before the transparent compiler fallback, and rustdoc is not instrumented.
