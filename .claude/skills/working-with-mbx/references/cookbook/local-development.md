Local development

Local development [​](#local-development)

mbx can sit underneath the tools already in a Rust development loop. Editors, file watchers, terminals, and worktrees may all keep invoking ordinary Cargo; their compilations share the same cache and machine-wide scheduler. Start with [Cargo and editor setup](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/setup), then use the recipes below for your editor, watch loop, and machine budget.

## Put editor checks through mbx [​](#put-editor-checks-through-mbx)

The native mise Rust option wraps Cargo but does not configure rust-analyzer. Run setup to add the editor integration:

sh

```
mbx setup
mbx setup --status
```

Setup gives rust-analyzer's background check an absolute path to mbx's stable Cargo shim. That matters for editors launched from a desktop icon: they often do not inherit the shell activation that puts mise's Cargo wrapper on `PATH`. The override lands in rust-analyzer's user configuration file, so one run covers every workspace. Project-level `rust-analyzer.toml` files do not apply this override to the editor's Cargo process. Restart the editor after setup so rust-analyzer reloads its configuration.

Setup leaves an existing rust-analyzer check configuration untouched. If `mbx setup --status` says that the editor kept its existing settings, either keep that command and make the editor inherit the shim directory printed by `mbx setup`, or change its `overrideCommand` executable to that absolute Cargo shim while preserving the command's existing arguments. Do not point the editor at a versioned mbx executable: the stable shim continues to work across upgrades.

To check the path seen by a terminal, run:

sh

```
command -v cargo
mbx doctor
```

On Windows, use `(Get-Command cargo).Path` instead of `command -v cargo`. See [Cargo and editor setup](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/setup#verify-plain-cargo) for the shell and non-interactive `PATH` setup.

## Run a watch loop [​](#run-a-watch-loop)

A watcher does not need mbx-specific integration. Once plain Cargo resolves to the shim, every Cargo process it starts participates. For example, with [`cargo-watch`](https://github.com/watchexec/cargo-watch):

sh

```
cargo install cargo-watch
cargo watch -x 'check --workspace'
```

Use a second terminal for the live view:

sh

```
mbx tui
```

The changed crate still has to compile, but unchanged dependencies can restore from any build or worktree on the machine. If another loop is already compiling the identical action, mbx waits for it and restores that result instead of running a duplicate compiler. The TUI makes both decisions visible by crate.

An editor background check and a watcher may request much of the same work. That is safe, but Cargo still plans both builds; keep both only when the watcher runs a different command such as tests, Clippy, or another feature set.

Do not add `cargo clean` to a watch loop. Cargo already rebuilds changed inputs, and deleting the target directory throws away its local freshness information. When a loop looks colder than expected, diagnose one iteration instead:

sh

```
mbx explain check --workspace
```

## Keep a laptop responsive [​](#keep-a-laptop-responsive)

All simultaneous mbx builds share one compiler pool. Its defaults use every logical CPU and 85% of physical memory, which favors throughput. A smaller machine-wide budget trades some cold-build speed for lower fan noise and more headroom for the editor and browser.

Add a budget to the platform config file listed on the [Configuration](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/configuration) page:

toml

```
[scheduler]
cpus = 4
memory = "8GiB"
```

Choose values for the machine; those numbers are an example. The CPU setting limits concurrent real compiler work across every terminal and worktree; cache hits do not consume permits. The memory setting prevents known large compilations from filling all CPU permits at once.

For a watch session with a smaller shared budget, set the same values in its environment. Child Cargo processes inherit them. These are scheduler settings, so consider the other builds sharing that pool:

sh

```
MBX_SCHEDULER_CPUS=2 MBX_SCHEDULER_MEMORY=4GiB \
  cargo watch -x 'check --workspace'
```

`scheduler.priority = "low"` is useful for unattended or background builds, but it is not a power limit: it yields capacity to normal-priority builds and may still use the whole configured pool when nothing else is waiting.

## Debug a binary restored from another checkout [​](#debug-a-binary-restored-from-another-checkout)

Restored artifacts behave the same, but are not guaranteed to contain the same bytes as a local compile. In particular, debug information can contain the absolute source path of the checkout that populated the cache. A debugger may therefore open an old worktree path or fail to bind a breakpoint even though the program itself is correct.

For a local final link while retaining cached dependency compilations, build into a separate target directory with native-link caching disabled:

sh

```
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=target/debugger MBX_CACHE_LINKS=0 \
  cargo build --bin my-program
```

Point the debugger at `target/debugger/debug/my-program`. The separate target directory forces Cargo to materialize a new build without disturbing the normal one, and disabling link caching makes the program itself local. This is usually enough to debug application code.

If source paths inside every dependency must also belong to the current checkout, bypass mbx for the isolated build:

sh

```
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=target/debugger-uncached MBX_DISABLE=1 \
  cargo build --bin my-program
```

This build is cold and is best reserved for path-sensitive debugger or artifact investigations. Remove the extra target directory when finished; the shared action cache remains intact. To check whether restored bytes diverge, use [`MBX_VERIFY=1`](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/configuration#verify-mode).
