Acknowledgements [​](#acknowledgements)

mbx depends on Cargo and builds on ideas established by earlier compiler caches. In particular, kache directly inspired the project's design.

## Cargo [​](#cargo)

[Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo) resolves dependencies, plans builds, and orchestrates rustc. Its `RUSTC_WRAPPER` integration lets mbx and other Rust compiler caches wrap compiler invocations.

## sccache [​](#sccache)

[sccache](https://github.com/mozilla/sccache) predates mbx and established compiler caching in the Rust ecosystem. It reuses compiler work locally and through remote storage, and supports a broader set of compilers and use cases than mbx.

See the [comparison with sccache](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/compared#sccache) for where mbx makes different tradeoffs.

## kache [​](#kache)

[kache](https://github.com/kunobi-ninja/kache) predates mbx and directly inspired its design. It combines a content-addressed `RUSTC_WRAPPER` cache with C and C++ compiler shims, remote storage, and executable caching.

The projects do not share code. Both aim to make compiled work reusable across checkouts; they differ in process lifecycle, storage management, and remote policy. The [comparison with kache](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/compared#kache) explains where mbx took a different direction and where kache may be the better fit.

## cargo-pretty [​](#cargo-pretty)

[cargo-pretty](https://github.com/romancitodev/cargo-pretty) by [romancitodev](https://github.com/romancitodev) provides the base for mbx's Cargo display: live and completed crate rows, per-crate timers, fading, and browsable warnings. mbx adds cache statistics and a progress bar colored by hits, misses, and bypasses while retaining Cargo's native run and test execution.

The adapted source retains romancitodev's MIT license and records the upstream revision in the repository's `NOTICE` file.
