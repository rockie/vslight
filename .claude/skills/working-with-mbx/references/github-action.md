GitHub Action

GitHub Action [​](#github-action)

[`jdx/mr-boxington-action`](https://github.com/jdx/mr-boxington-action) installs or reuses mbx and configures caching for the job. Start with the default GitHub backend; use a server when you need object sharing across runners. The [action repository](https://github.com/jdx/mr-boxington-action) owns the complete input reference.

## Start with a complete workflow [​](#start-with-a-complete-workflow)

Save this as `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. It uses the runner's Rust toolchain; add your toolchain installation step before the cache action if you pin one.

yaml

```
name: ci

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7
      - uses: jdx/mr-boxington-action@v1
      - run: mbx test --workspace
```

The push to `main` fills the archive for later runs. Pull requests restore it without saving new entries. Most examples below are snippets for an existing job's `steps` list.

## Read the CI summary [​](#read-the-ci-summary)

mbx automatically uses its explanatory CI build summary in GitHub Actions and skips local first-run onboarding. The summary describes mbx's **object cache**; it does not count artifacts Cargo reused directly from the restored target directory or the action's archive downloads and uploads. The action reports archive restore/save results separately. Use `MBX_SUMMARY=short`, `full`, or `off` to override the default; see [build summaries](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/configuration#build-summaries).

## GitHub Actions cache [​](#github-actions-cache)

The default backend restores a pruned Cargo target directory and registry from a compatible archive. Cargo can then reuse its own fresh outputs. A new immutable entry is saved after a push to the default branch, or a trusted `workflow_dispatch` run when `save-on-workflow-dispatch` is enabled. Pull requests, including forks, are restore-only.

The action manages target placement for this archive mode. Local defaults for managed targets and link caching may be overridden by the transport; inspect the action's inputs before assuming a local configuration applies unchanged.

yaml

```
permissions:
  contents: read

steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v7
  - uses: jdx/mr-boxington-action@v1
  - run: mbx test --workspace
```

Use `github-cache-mode: objects` when several target directories or checkout layouts need to share one entry. This mode exports the actions used or produced by the job and omits the Cargo registry. Cargo may need to download crates again unless you cache those downloads separately.

yaml

```
- uses: jdx/mr-boxington-action@v1
  with:
    github-cache-mode: objects
```

Change `cache-generation` when a format or policy change should start a new archive series:

yaml

```
- uses: jdx/mr-boxington-action@v1
  with:
    cache-generation: v2
```

### Match the toolchain [​](#match-the-toolchain)

Generated keys cover the operating system, the architecture, and the identity of the `rustc` on `PATH`, because a store built by one compiler matches nothing under another. Install the toolchain before the action, and name it in the action's `toolchain` input when the build selects its own, as `mbx +1.91 check` does. Advanced workflows can provide complete `cache-key` and `restore-keys` inputs. The `toolchain` input scopes the key; it does not install or select the toolchain for the build.

## Parallel Cargo steps [​](#parallel-cargo-steps)

Run multiple Cargo builds at the same time by starting independent lint or test configurations together using GitHub's [`parallel` step group](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/workflow-syntax#jobsjob_idstepsparallel). mbx gives every compiler they launch one machine-wide CPU and memory budget:

yaml

```
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v7
  - uses: jdx/mr-boxington-action@v1
  - parallel:
      - name: Clippy with default features
        env:
          CARGO_TARGET_DIR: ${{ runner.temp }}/clippy-default
        run: mbx clippy --workspace -- -D warnings
      - name: Clippy with all features and targets
        env:
          CARGO_TARGET_DIR: ${{ runner.temp }}/clippy-all
        run: mbx clippy --workspace --all-features --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

Each command needs a separate `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`; otherwise Cargo's target directory lock serializes the parallel steps. The mbx store and scheduler stay shared, so the steps run side by side on one CPU and memory budget instead of each Cargo process filling the runner on its own.

Measure the complete job on your workload. See [Parallel builds](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/scheduling) for tuning and [Benchmarks](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/benchmarks#six-parallel-jobs) for a measured batch.

## Docker builds [​](#docker-builds)

Mount the mbx store and Cargo registry into the container at stable locations. The registry may either be mounted directly at `$CARGO_HOME/registry` or mounted elsewhere and symlinked from there:

sh

```
docker run --rm \
  --env CARGO_HOME=/tmp/cargo-home \
  --env HOME=/tmp/build-home \
  --mount "type=bind,source=$HOME/.cargo/registry,target=/tmp/host-cargo-registry" \
  --mount "type=bind,source=$HOME/.cache/mbx,target=/tmp/build-home/.cache/mbx" \
  builder \
  sh -c 'mkdir -p "$CARGO_HOME" && ln -s /tmp/host-cargo-registry "$CARGO_HOME/registry" && mbx build'
```

mbx maps the registry separately from the rest of `CARGO_HOME`, so cached compiler inputs remain portable when that child symlink resolves outside the Cargo home directory.

## Closure bundles for action transports [​](#closure-bundles-for-action-transports)

An action can transport only the cache entries produced or used by its builds, instead of archiving the whole local store. Every completed `mbx` command writes an immutable receipt into the group named by `MBX_CACHE_EXPORT_GROUP`, including commands running in parallel or in different checkouts. `jdx/mr-boxington-action` sets that group itself; another transport assigns a unique opaque value for the job before any build steps run.

A restore phase imports a previously cached bundle:

console

```
mbx cache import "$RUNNER_TEMP/mbx-cache.tar"
```

The bundle also carries Cargo's scheduler state for each recorded workspace. When import runs from a matching checkout whose target directory is absent or empty, mbx restores the fingerprints, dep-info, build-script state, and target layout alongside the action closure. Large compiler outputs remain CAS objects and are reflinked or copied into that layout rather than stored twice. Import leaves a non-empty target directory untouched.

A post phase exports the deduplicated closure of every receipt in this job:

console

```
mbx cache export --group "$MBX_CACHE_EXPORT_GROUP" "$RUNNER_TEMP/mbx-cache.tar"
```

The group should include the run attempt, job, and matrix identity, or be a fresh random value generated for the run. It identifies builds within one job. It is not the GitHub Actions cache key. A post step should skip saving when no completed build was recorded or when the workflow's trust policy forbids a cache write.

## Manual GitHub cache setup [​](#manual-github-cache-setup)

The equivalent pieces can be assembled directly when Cargo download caches or custom save policies need to share the same entry:

yaml

```
- uses: actions/cache@v6
  with:
    path: |
      ~/.cargo/registry
      ~/.cargo/git
      ~/.cargo/.global-cache
      ~/.cache/mbx
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-${{ runner.arch }}-mbx-${{ github.sha }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-${{ runner.arch }}-mbx-
- uses: jdx/mise-action@v4
  with:
    cache: false
    install_args: mr-boxington
- run: mbx test --workspace
- run: mbx gc --max-size 3GB
  if: always()
```

Use `actions/cache/restore` instead of `actions/cache` in pull requests so the restore action does not also save an entry. Storage permissions and workflow trust still determine what code in the job can access.

Pin actions in production

The examples use major tags for readability. Pin third-party actions to full commit SHAs in a real workflow.

## Cache server [​](#cache-server)

For trusted runners and teams, mbx can talk to a compatible remote server such as the self-hostable [cache server](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/cache-server). The action exports the remote configuration for subsequent steps:

yaml

```
permissions:
  contents: read
  id-token: write

steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v7
  - uses: jdx/mr-boxington-action@v1
    with:
      backend: server
      server-url: https://cache.example.com
      namespace: acme/backend
      oidc-audience: mbx-cache
  - run: mbx build --workspace --all-features
```

Only a push to a protected branch may write. Pull requests and tag or release builds degrade to read-only. If fork authors must not reach the host, use the GitHub backend for those jobs instead. A bearer token can be supplied with the action's `token` input when OIDC is unavailable.

## S3-compatible bucket [​](#s3-compatible-bucket)

A bucket needs nothing running. [`aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials`](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials) exchanges the runner's OIDC token for a role and exports the credentials mbx reads, so no long-lived secret is stored:

yaml

```
permissions:
  contents: read
  id-token: write

env:
  MBX_REMOTE_URL: s3://acme-build-cache
  MBX_REMOTE_NAMESPACE: acme/backend

steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v7
  - uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v5
    with:
      role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/mbx-cache
      aws-region: us-west-2
  - uses: jdx/mise-action@v4
    with:
      cache: false
      install_args: mr-boxington
  - run: mbx build --workspace --all-features
```

This example installs mbx with `jdx/mise-action` instead of [`jdx/mr-boxington-action`](https://github.com/jdx/mr-boxington-action), because the action's GitHub Actions cache backend would store the same actions a second time. Use one or the other.

mbx still refuses to publish from a pull request. A bucket has no server to authorize anything, so make IAM agree: scope the role's trust policy to the branches allowed to assume it, and give pull request jobs a role that can only read. See [remote cache](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/remote-cache#who-may-publish).

## Production releases [​](#production-releases)

Keep published artifacts independent of remote compiler caches

A production release may still use `mbx` and its local cache, but should not use a remote cache so a cache-poisoning attack cannot influence published artifacts. Release jobs should also avoid restoring or saving compiler outputs through `actions/cache` or the GitHub backend. The client's tag/release write restriction does not disable remote reads automatically: remove remote configuration and archive restore steps explicitly.

For a repository that combines both backends, the server for trusted runs and the GitHub cache for fork pull requests, see [CI with fork pull requests](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/cookbook/fork-prs).
