Stability [​](#stability)

The CLI, machine-readable reports, local cache, and embedding APIs have different compatibility rules. Use this page when planning an upgrade or building tooling around mbx.

## The store is disposable [​](#the-store-is-disposable)

The local store is a cache of work mbx can redo. Correctness never depends on its format: an entry a new version cannot read is a miss, and the compilation runs again. The worst case for any upgrade is a colder build, not a wrong one, and cached compilations can be regenerated. Stop builds before manually deleting the whole root: it also contains managed targets and private state. Prefer [`mbx gc`](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/managed-targets#inspect-and-clean-up) for routine cleanup.

Managed target directories live under a versioned root (`targets/v1/…`), and the `target` symlink in each checkout keeps working across upgrades.

The store is also not fsynced. Cached objects and action results are published by atomic rename, so a reader sees a whole file or none, but a crash or power cut before the bytes reach disk can leave a file whose content does not match its name. Every object is checked against its content hash the first time a build reads it, and one that fails is a miss: the compilation runs again and its result is republished over the bad bytes. Records that only shortcut work, such as the input list a finished compilation leaves for the next build of the same invocation, are written the same way and ignored when they fail to parse. `mbx cache verify` reads the whole store back and reports any object left in that state.

## JSON output is versioned [​](#json-output-is-versioned)

`mbx doctor --json`, `mbx stats --json`, `mbx cache stats --json`, `mbx gc --json`, and `MBX_STATS_REPORT` emit versioned documents; fields are added compatibly and a shape change bumps the version. Scripts should read the version field and parse the JSON. The `mbx[...]` stderr lines are written for people and may be reworded at any time.

### Session event streams are not a public API [​](#session-event-streams-are-not)

The per-compilation streams under `sessions/v1/` that back [`mbx tui`](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/tui) are an implementation detail of that command. Their records carry a version field, but the format may change in any release. Use mbx commands to read them; scripts should consume `MBX_STATS_REPORT` for build statistics.

## Configuration [​](#configuration)

Unknown TOML keys and invalid values are errors, so an upgrade that renames or retires a setting fails instead of ignoring what you wrote.

## Wire protocols and crates [​](#wire-protocols-and-crates)

The local shim/agent protocol requires exact protocol and application-version equality. Embedders can connect to it, but must upgrade their client alongside mbx when that exact-match version changes. The remote cache protocol is versioned under `/v1/` with explicit evolution rules. Published Rust subcrates remain on `0.x`, so their APIs may change in a minor release. See [protocol compatibility](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/protocol-compatibility) for the details.

`mbx-cache-cargo`, `mbx-cache-store`, `mbx-cache-core`, `mbx-cache-rustc`, and `mbx-cache-cc` are supported building blocks for coordinated embedding. They stay on `0.x`: their public APIs can change in a new minor release, and embedders should pin a compatible minor. Store and wire formats remain independently versioned and treat unfamiliar records as cache misses.
