Cache server

Cache server [​](#cache-server)

[`jdx/mr-boxington-cache`](https://github.com/jdx/mr-boxington-cache) is the self-hostable remote cache server. It implements version 1 of the mbx action-cache protocol: immutable blobs, atomic action-result commits, namespace isolation, and streaming blob packs. It also serves [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev)'s task cache. Any server implementing the [protocol](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/protocol-compatibility) works with mbx; this page documents the reference implementation.

## Run it [​](#run-it)

Clone the server repository before starting its development stack. It runs the service, PostgreSQL, and MinIO:

sh

```
git clone https://github.com/jdx/mr-boxington-cache.git
cd mr-boxington-cache
docker compose up --build
```

For a standalone instance with filesystem storage:

sh

```
cargo install mbx-cache --locked
mbx-cache \
  --allow-anonymous \
  --data-dir ./data \
  --listen 127.0.0.1:8080
```

The standalone example binds to loopback and allows anonymous access for local evaluation. Production installations should terminate TLS at an ingress or proxy and configure tokens. The repository ships a Helm chart for horizontally scaled Kubernetes deployments and a Terraform-managed single-host example.

Connect mbx to the local example with this global configuration:

toml

```
[remote]
url = "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
namespace = "example/project"
mode = "read-only"
```

Run `mbx doctor` to check connectivity. A local shell is read-only even when `mode` is `read-write`; use [trusted CI](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/remote-cache#read-and-write-policy) to populate the remote through mbx. For an authenticated deployment, use HTTPS and add a token or OIDC audience as described in [Remote cache](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/remote-cache).

## Configuration [​](#configuration)

Every option has a matching environment variable and CLI flag; run `mbx-cache --help` for the complete list.

| Environment variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MBX_CACHE_LISTEN` | `0.0.0.0:8080` | Listen address |
| `MBX_CACHE_STORAGE` | `filesystem` | `filesystem` or `s3` |
| `MBX_CACHE_DATA_DIR` | `/var/lib/mbx-cache` | Filesystem blob root |
| `MBX_CACHE_DATABASE_URL` | `memory://` | PostgreSQL URL or development memory store |
| `MBX_CACHE_S3_BUCKET` | none | Required for S3 storage |
| `MBX_CACHE_S3_PREFIX` | `v1` | Object-key prefix |
| `MBX_CACHE_S3_ENDPOINT` | AWS default | S3-compatible endpoint |
| `MBX_CACHE_S3_REGION` | `us-east-1` | S3 region |
| `MBX_CACHE_S3_PATH_STYLE` | `false` | Enable for MinIO and similar services |
| `MBX_CACHE_TOKENS_JSON` | none | Static token grants |
| `MBX_CACHE_OIDC_PROVIDERS_JSON` | none | Trusted OIDC providers and claim grants |
| `MBX_CACHE_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS` | `false` | Allow access without configured grants |
| `MBX_CACHE_MAX_BLOB_BYTES` | `5368709120` | Maximum upload size |

AWS credentials use the standard SDK credential chain, including environment variables, workload identity, ECS, and EC2 roles.

## Authorization [​](#authorization)

Authorization is deny-by-default. Namespace patterns may be an exact name, `*`, or a prefix ending in `/*`.

### Static tokens [​](#static-tokens)

`MBX_CACHE_TOKENS_JSON` is an array of grants:

json

```
[
  {
    "token": "replace-with-a-secret",
    "read": ["acme/*", "public"],
    "write": ["acme/project-a"]
  }
]
```

Rotate tokens by deploying the old and new grants together, moving clients to the new token, then removing the old grant. Inject the JSON through a secret, not through deployment configuration.

### OIDC [​](#oidc)

OIDC lets CI use short-lived identity tokens instead of stored secrets. Configure trusted issuers, acceptable audiences, and claim-based grants. This example grants access only to pushes on `acme/backend`'s `main` branch. Replace the numeric owner ID and add separate read-only rules for any other identities that need access:

json

```
[
  {
    "issuer": "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com",
    "audiences": ["https://cache.example.com"],
    "rules": [
      {
        "claims": {
          "repository": "acme/backend",
          "repository_owner_id": "12345",
          "ref": "refs/heads/main",
          "event_name": "push"
        },
        "read": ["acme/backend"],
        "write": ["acme/backend"]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

The server discovers the issuer's JWKS endpoint and verifies the signature, issuer, audience, expiry, not-before time, and subject before applying the first matching rule. Rules are alternatives; every claim within a rule must match exactly. Pin stable identity claims such as GitHub's numeric `repository_owner_id` alongside the repository name, since names can be reclaimed and the ID cannot. Add `ref` or `environment` claims when only a narrower workflow identity should write. Symmetric JWT algorithms are never accepted.

On the client side, mbx acquires the GitHub Actions job token itself: set `MBX_REMOTE_OIDC_AUDIENCE`, or use [`jdx/mr-boxington-action`](https://github.com/jdx/mr-boxington-action) with `backend: server` as shown in [GitHub Action](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/github-action#cache-server).

## Operations [​](#operations)

For S3-backed storage, expire blobs with a bucket lifecycle rule. Run a separate metadata sweep to remove old records; this command exits after cleanup without starting the server:

sh

```
mbx-cache --sweep-metadata-older-than-days 35
```

Keep the sweep age longer than the storage lifecycle so objects expire first. A dangling reference is never fatal: a client that cannot fetch a blob treats the action as a miss and recompiles.

Multiple stateless replicas can run against the same PostgreSQL database and S3 bucket. Readiness and liveness probes use `/v1/status`, and `/metrics` exposes Prometheus counters for actions, blobs, and blob-pack transfers with fixed, low-cardinality labels. Namespaces, tokens, and digests never appear as labels. The server has no deletion endpoint. Retention and disaster recovery are administrative concerns: back up PostgreSQL, and use bucket versioning or replication as required.

A server advertising action promises can coordinate identical cold compilations across replicas. Claims are short-lived database leases scoped by namespace and invocation digest; completion is accepted only after the named action result is durable. Abandoned claims expire, completed promises are immutable for their retention window, and no promise endpoint bypasses the namespace's write authorization.

## Protocol [​](#protocol)

The wire protocol (endpoints, media types, canonical hashing, and the evolution rules) is documented in [protocol compatibility](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/protocol-compatibility). The [repository README](https://github.com/jdx/mr-boxington-cache) covers implementation details beyond it, including blob-pack framing and validation behavior.
