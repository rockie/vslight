How it works

How it works [​](#how-it-works)

mbx works at the compiler boundary. Cargo decides which tools need to run; mbx decides whether each eligible invocation can be restored from cached work. An **action** is one modeled invocation and its inputs. The **content-addressed store** (CAS) holds outputs under digests of their content.

Run `mbx build` directly, or use ordinary `cargo build` after [enabling automatic wrapping](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/setup). Both follow the same build lifecycle.

## From command to result [​](#from-command-to-result)

1. mbx resolves the workspace and target roots through Cargo metadata.
2. It starts an in-process cache agent and creates shims for the build.
3. Cargo runs normally with the rustc shim set as `RUSTC_WRAPPER`, and build scripts inherit `HOST_CC` and `HOST_CXX` pointing at the C and C++ shims.
4. Each shim analyzes its compiler invocation and derives a content-addressed action key.
5. A hit restores the action's outputs; a miss runs the real compiler and publishes the result. The compiler's diagnostics and artifact notifications reach Cargo as rustc prints them, so Cargo starts a crate's dependents against its metadata while code generation and publication continue, the same as without mbx. `forward_compiler_notifications = false` ( `MBX_FORWARD_COMPILER_NOTIFICATIONS=0`) holds the output until the result is stored, for diagnosing the shim.
6. The agent exits with the build, draining any remote uploads it still owes. There is no persistent daemon.

That wrapper boundary also covers multiple Cargo builds running at the same time. Their compiler shims share a machine-wide permit pool and an in-flight-work registry, so those builds do not multiply the machine's CPU and memory budgets or repeat an identical cold compilation. [Machine-wide scheduling](#machine-wide-scheduling) below describes the mechanism, and the [mise task example](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/scheduling#run-independent-tasks) and [parallel GitHub Actions example](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/github-action#parallel-cargo-steps) are ready-to-use recipes.

## Build-script C and C++ [​](#build-script-c-and-c)

Cargo has no `CC_WRAPPER`, so the shims arrive as compiler variables themselves, resolved to the platform compilers when the session starts. They are set as `HOST_CC` and `HOST_CXX` rather than `CC` and `CXX`: the `cc` crate consults the host pair only when it is not cross-compiling, and these shims wrap the host compiler, so a `cargo build --target` keeps the cross compiler it would have found on its own. An explicit host compiler in `CC`, `CXX`, `HOST_CC`, or `HOST_CXX` is left alone. Explicit target compilers can be wrapped; see the [C and C++ limits](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/limits#c-and-c-caching-covers-the-host-compiles-mbx-drives). `MBX_CC=0` turns this caching off.

The C shim requests a private dependency list and keys the compilation on the files it names. A cold call may need to compile before that list is known; the stored result and prediction can serve later builds.

If the build requests its own depfile with `-MD` or `-MMD`, mbx writes one on both a compilation and a cache hit. Depfile formatting flags affect that file without changing the object-cache key.

The key also records include-directory names that could change which header an `#include` resolves to. Adding a header that shadows an existing one must invalidate the result even if every previously read file is unchanged. See [include shadowing](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/limits#shadowing-is-modeled-by-name-not-by-content) for the manifest rules.

## Portable keys [​](#portable-keys)

Known workspace, target, Cargo registry, toolchain, and sysroot paths are mapped to stable placeholders before they enter a key. That is what lets equivalent worktrees share an action even though their absolute paths differ.

The key also covers compiler inputs and relevant environment. If mbx cannot model something exactly, it bypasses the action.

## Prediction and dep-info [​](#prediction-and-dep-info)

A rustc action key depends on the files that compilation actually reads. mbx learns that set from Cargo/rustc dep-info left by an earlier build and records a prediction for later invocations. A cold compilation may therefore have no key to look up yet. It still gets stored after compiling and can warm the next build.

Predictions are grouped by the `Cargo.lock` digest. When a dependency update creates a new group, mbx looks for earlier predictions in up to eight lockfile states from Git history, then in recent local store records. Each borrowed prediction is checked against the current inputs: unchanged crates can hit, while changed crates compile and record new predictions.

mbx saves the borrowed record under the new lockfile for subsequent commands, and eligible trusted CI builds publish it remotely. A shallow clone limits which history is available. For GitHub Actions' default pull-request merge checkout, `fetch-depth: 2` includes the base parent; a depth-one checkout relies on local store records.

Hashing those files is shared too. The agent keeps a ledger of every file a shim has hashed, keyed by the file's length, modification time, and change time, so a dependency's rlib is read once however many crates link it. The ledger is saved with the checkout's private state when the build finishes and loaded by its next build, avoiding repeated reads of unchanged dependencies. Reuse depends on the file-identity checks supported by that filesystem; network filesystems receive additional content validation. If an entry cannot be validated, mbx hashes the file again.

## Rustdoc actions [​](#rustdoc-actions)

Cargo invokes rustdoc through a separate shim. Each documentation action keys the rustdoc version and arguments, the package source tree, explicit compiler artifacts, and Cargo's compile-time environment. Rustdoc's mergeable-output mode separates deterministic per-crate pages from files such as the search index that combine every documented crate. mbx caches the former with the crate's merge metadata and runs rustdoc's inexpensive finalization step after restoring them, so cached dependency documentation remains composable and the shared indexes do not depend on restore order.

## Copy-on-write output restoration [​](#copy-on-write-output-restoration)

The cache agent verifies each local CAS blob against its digest before returning it to the rustc wrapper. The wrapper first tries to reflink that verified blob into a staging directory beside Cargo's destination, applies the expected file mode, and atomically renames it into place. A reflink is an ordinary file that shares its data blocks with the CAS until either copy is written, so Cargo sees the complete output immediately without the wrapper re-reading or allocating all of its data after verification. Writes to a restored output cannot change the CAS object.

Reflinks require support from the filesystem and generally require the cache and target directory to be on the same filesystem. When cloning is unavailable, mbx copies the bytes instead. The session summary reports the file count and logical size handled by each path; `MBX_STATS_REPORT` includes the same values as `reflinked_output_files`, `reflinked_output_bytes`, `copied_output_files`, and `copied_output_bytes`.

This is filesystem copy-on-write, not a placeholder or userspace on-demand filesystem. Restored paths retain normal file semantics on every supported platform, including when mbx has to use the copy fallback.

## Machine-wide scheduling [​](#machine-wide-scheduling)

Every compiler mbx starts takes a permit from one pool shared by every build on the machine, so simultaneous builds do not multiply the machine's CPU and memory budgets. Cache hits never wait, Cargo keeps its own dependency scheduling, and permits are released by the kernel if a process dies, so a crashed build cannot wedge its siblings.

Concurrent builds also stop repeating each other. Separate CI jobs with fresh targets can otherwise repeat the same dependency compilations. With mbx, a compilation identical to one already running against the same local cache waits for that one to finish and restores its result from the cache. The finished compilation also leaves its input list behind, so a job arriving after it is already done can build the cache key it would otherwise lack and hit where it would have compiled cold. Both paths rehash every input before trusting anything, so the worst a stale record can do is fall back to compiling.

Permits are weighted by memory. Native links start at two permits, and every compilation is thereafter weighted by what it actually used, so admission uses the estimated memory cost of the running work. This is a scheduling estimate, not an operating-system memory limit. A link that turns out to fit in one permit stops being charged for two, which keeps the link-heavy tail of a build from running at half concurrency. A link mbx has never seen is weighed by the heaviest of this machine's recent links; test binaries each have their own crate name, so a cold `cargo test --no-run` has no per-crate history for the links in front of it. A compilation the Linux OOM killer stops is recorded heavier than it measured, so its retry runs with more room.

The pool size, memory budget, and priority are settings; see [machine-wide compile scheduling](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/scheduling#machine-wide-compile-scheduling).

## What remains local [​](#what-remains-local)

Cargo's target state belongs to a workspace. Learned incremental state belongs to a checkout and never enters the shared cache. A configured remote receives eligible shared actions according to the [write policy](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/remote-cache#read-and-write-policy). [Managed targets](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/managed-targets) and garbage collection control local retention.

## Correctness first [​](#correctness-first)

Unsupported crate types, unmodeled search paths, and incremental compilations bypass the shared action cache. That includes the private incremental state of [learned incremental reuse](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/incremental#learned-incremental-reuse), which is never published. A compilation that links nothing is cached whatever its crate type: `cargo check` and clippy compile every binary and test target that way. A native link is admitted only when its linker can be described: host binaries, tests, and proc macros on Linux, macOS, and Windows, where mbx puts the resolved linker, startup objects, C runtime, and SDK into the key, and a fixed allowlist of built-in WebAssembly targets whose default linker and system inputs ship with rustc. Everything else (native libraries, custom linkers, unrecognized toolchains) links as it always did; see [limits](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/limits#native-linking-is-cached-only-where-the-linker-can-be-described). A library that names a native library is cached: nothing links, so a `-l static` archive is hashed into its key like an `--extern` artifact, and other `-l` kinds are keyed by name; see [limits](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/limits#native-libraries-are-inputs-where-nothing-links). `MBX_VERIFY=1` compiles while also consulting the cache and compares the result, an expensive qualification mode.
