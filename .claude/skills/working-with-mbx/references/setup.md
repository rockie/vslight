Set up Cargo and your editor

Set up Cargo and your editor [​](#set-up-cargo-and-your-editor)

## Native mise integration [​](#native-mise-integration)

With mise 2026.9.2 or newer:

sh

```
mise use --global --tool-option mr_boxington=true rust mr-boxington
```

This enables ordinary Cargo commands through mise without running `mbx setup`. Use `mise exec -- cargo build`, `mise run` tasks, or a shell with mise activation or shims on `PATH`. Rust and mbx remain independently versioned. Drop `--global` for a project-scoped configuration.

## Standalone setup [​](#standalone-setup)

After [installing mbx](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/installation), run this to install a stable Cargo shim and configure rust-analyzer:

sh

```
mbx setup
mbx setup --status
```

Setup offers explicit mise wrapper and rust-analyzer integration. It is useful for older mise versions or applications that need an absolute Cargo shim path. To try mbx without changing your setup, run `mbx build` directly.

## Choose a scope [​](#choose-a-scope)

| Command | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| `mbx setup` | Prompt for the recommended configuration |
| `mbx setup --yes` | Accept the recommendation |
| `mbx setup --global` | Global mise configuration |
| `mbx setup --local` | Current project's mise configuration |

During `mise use --postinstall`, `mbx setup --yes` adds a `[wrappers.cargo]` entry to the configuration named by `MISE_CONFIG_FILE`. Otherwise, setup only integrates with mise when mise is activated in the current shell. It recommends the config that defines `mr-boxington`, then the nearest project config, and finally the global config. `mbx setup` prompts before using that recommendation; `--yes` accepts it. Without an active mise shell, setup prints the exact shell-specific `PATH` change and never edits a shell startup file. Setup runs `mise reshim` after adding or removing the wrapper.

The explicit wrapper written by `mbx setup` requires mise 2026.8.16 or newer.

## Share setup with a project [​](#share-setup-with-a-project)

With mise 2026.9.2 or newer, commit the tool option in the project's `mise.toml`:

toml

```
[tools]
rust = { version = "stable", mr_boxington = true }
mr-boxington = "latest"
```

Keep the project's existing Rust version and other options when adding `mr_boxington = true`. Both tools must be configured. Run `mise install`, then use `mise exec -- cargo build`, project tasks with `mise run`, or plain `cargo` with mise activation or shims on `PATH`.

Set `mr_boxington = false` on the project's Rust entry to disable native wrapping there. An explicit `[wrappers.cargo]` takes precedence over the Rust option, including `false`. When migrating from `mbx setup`, remove the old mbx `[wrappers.cargo]` entry and its `postinstall` hook from the applicable config so the Rust option controls wrapping. Run `mise reshim` after migrating.

## Verify plain Cargo [​](#verify-plain-cargo)

Open a new shell after setup and verify that Cargo resolves to mise's command wrapper, a mise shim, or the stable mbx shim, depending on how you activated it. On Unix:

sh

```
command -v cargo
# ~/.local/share/mise/command-wrappers/bin/cargo on Linux
```

On Windows, use PowerShell or `where.exe`:

powershell

```
(Get-Command cargo).Path
where.exe cargo
```

mise activation supplies the command-wrapper path to shells where mise is active. The wrapper invokes `mbx` with Cargo shim mode enabled, then mise removes its dispatch directories before mbx delegates to the configured or system Cargo. Calling `~/.cargo/bin/cargo` directly bypasses mise's integration.

### Desktop applications and non-interactive commands [​](#desktop-applications-and-non-interactive-commands)

For coding agents, SSH commands, and other non-interactive tools, use `mise exec -- cargo build` or put mise's shims directory on their `PATH`. When using shims, `command -v cargo` resolves to the mise shim rather than the command-wrapper directory; both honor the Rust option.

Desktop applications such as Codex may inherit a different `PATH` from an interactive terminal. Check `command -v cargo` from a command run by the application itself. Configure its command environment to include mise's shims, or use `mise exec -- cargo build` for build commands. Restart the application after changing its inherited environment.

If you prefer mbx's standalone launcher, run `mbx setup` and prepend the directory it prints to the environment those processes use. For zsh, `~/.zshenv` applies to interactive and non-interactive shells. For example, the default Linux location is:

sh

```
export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/mbx/bin:$PATH"
```

On macOS, the default is different:

sh

```
export PATH="$HOME/Library/Application Support/mbx/bin:$PATH"
```

Use the path setup prints if your data directory is customized.

Start a new process and run `command -v cargo` again. Once it resolves to the shim, ordinary `cargo build`, `cargo test`, and `cargo check` commands use mbx automatically. Prefixing a Cargo command with `mbx`, as in `mbx build`, still works.

Outside mise activation, the stable `cargo` launcher uses the setup-time mbx while it exists, then resolves the active `mbx` from `PATH` after an upgrade removes that path. Windows `cargo.exe` resolves the active mbx from `PATH`, with the setup-time path as a fallback. Upgrading a mise-managed mbx does not require running setup again.

## rust-analyzer [​](#rust-analyzer)

The native mise option does not configure editor checks. Run `mbx setup` to configure rust-analyzer's background check. Setup writes the override to rust-analyzer's user configuration file and prints the path, whichever mise scope activation uses. For the TOML integration used by setup, the override belongs in that user file. A `rust-analyzer.toml` beside `Cargo.toml` does not apply the override to the editor's Cargo process.

The editor invokes the stable Cargo shim by its absolute path, so its build shares mbx's cache and machine-wide compiler pool even when the editor did not inherit mise's `PATH`. Its outputs go to `target/rust-analyzer`, separate from terminal builds so the two Cargo processes do not contend on the target-directory lock. When `target` is managed, the editor directory lives inside that view and is collected with it, while the shared store warms both builds. Existing rust-analyzer check settings are left unchanged.

Releases through 1.11.0 wrote the override beside `Cargo.toml` when mbx was activated in a project mise scope, where rust-analyzer never read it. `mbx setup` and `mbx setup --uninstall` take that setting back out and report the file they cleaned.

## Remove automatic wrapping [​](#remove-automatic-wrapping)

For native mise integration, remove `mr_boxington` or set it to `false` in each Rust tool entry where you enabled it, then run `mise reshim`. Keep the Rust version and any unrelated tool options. Do this before removing mr-boxington from `[tools]`.

If you ran standalone setup as well:

sh

```
mbx setup --uninstall
```

Use `--global` or `--local` to select a mise scope explicitly. Repeat for each scope you enabled, and remove any mbx `PATH` entry you added manually. Open a new shell and check Cargo's path again. Uninstalling activation does not remove the mbx executable or clear the cache.

One user-level rust-analyzer override serves every scope, so uninstalling a project scope leaves it in place for the others, the way it leaves the Cargo shim. Uninstalling the global scope removes it.

## Shell completions [​](#shell-completions)

Generate a completion script for `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`, or `powershell`:

sh

```
mbx completion zsh > _mbx
```

Install the generated file in your shell's completion directory. The script is self-contained. See the [completion reference](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/cli/completion).
